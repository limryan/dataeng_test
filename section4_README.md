## `section4.ipynb`
Working notebook to pull the data from covid19api.com, convert it to a pandas dataframe and graph it using plotly. Two graphs were generated: 
- one showing the data of the cumulative confirmed case counts, number of deaths, recovered case counts, and active case counts
- another showing the daily new cases (derived from the difference in confirmed cases between each day)
  
For the dashboard displaying both graphs, please use the python file.
