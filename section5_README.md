Data from `car.csv` was loaded and prepared for training a model by encoding the categorical data. Two models were tried: Decision Tree and MLP.

The decision tree model was able to achieve a high accuracy on the test data and predicted that a car with high maintenance cost, 4 doors, big boot size, high safety and a good class value would have a low buying price.

The MLP model had a low accuracy on the test data and for the same example above, it predicted a medium buying price.
